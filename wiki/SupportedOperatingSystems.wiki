= Supported Operating Systems. =

For now !AddOn works under:
  * Windows (tested under Windows XP Home/Pro in Polish and English edition).
  * Linux (tested on Ubuntu 7.04 with Java 6)
  * Vista Home Premium 32-bit, Java SE 6, !OpenOffice 2.4.1
  * OpenSolaris 32-bit and 64-bit, Java SE 6, !OpenOffice 3.0

!AddOn should also works under other systems. 
If somebody tried it under any other OS please inform [http://www.przemelek.pl/kontakt me].
 
For work !AddOn needs Sun Java 6, also !OpenOffice must be configured to use Sun Java 6 (if you have more then one JVM in your system (very common situation) probably you need to set proper for !OpenOfficem, instruction how do it you may find in [KnownIssues])
